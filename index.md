## About Me

Hello!👋 My name is Junyoung Park, and I am a Post.Doc. researcher in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Pusan National University.
I am working with Prof.Ilkyu EOM at ISPL (Image Signal Processing Lab), and I have a M.S and Ph.D. in image processing and Artificial Intelligence at Pusan National University.

My research interests are image processing, computer vision, machine/deep learning, and artificial intelligence.

I am especially focused on post-processing that enhances images, enhancements and restoration in camera sensor units, and I am currently interested in image enhancement(restoration) and processing using Generative AI.

Additionally, I am currently conducting research in the field of deepfake detection through generative AI, and I am also interested in using domain adaptation technology to enable AI to produce results regardless of the domain of images. 
Trough my work, I want to contribute to showing people a brighter 👀, brighter world 🌏 based on new technology.
